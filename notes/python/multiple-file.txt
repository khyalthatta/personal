# How to create multiple file at once using python 

First, 

Create the base directory

i.e.

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

Now name the folder you want to create and join to the base dir.

i.e.

file_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "<Folder_Name>")

Use os.makedirs to build the folder

i.e.

os.makedirs(file_dir, exist_ok=True)

Now you have successfully create the folder named "<Folder_Name>"


Second, 

Iterate the file like (.txt .jpg etc.) inside the created folder.

For That, 

for i in range(0, 5):
	fname = f"{i}.txt"
	file_path = os.path.join(file_dir, fname)
	if os.path.exists(file_path):
		continue
	with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
		f.write("<Text you want to write>")

Result, 

It will iterate 5 times to create 5 .txt file in the <Folder_Name> that you have created.
