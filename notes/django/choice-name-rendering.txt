#How to render your choice name rather than its value in django template.

i.e.

<model_instance>.get_<model_attribute>_display

Example

class Foo(models.Model):
    GENDER_CHOICES = (
        ('M', 'Male'),
        ('F', 'Female'),
    )
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=GENDER_CHOICES)

Now, you want to display the gender field in a template. 
If you use the {{ person.gender }} variable, 
you would get "M" or "F" to display on your page. 
But what if you want "Male" or "Female"? 
Then you would use {{ person.get_gender_display }}.
